            <p>Rather than an activity with a clear outcome, design has also become a medium itself, a system of signs.
                From economic flows and legal infrastructures to interfaces, virtual addresses and augmented realities, we are dealing with another type of world that generates economic value from information, fictional, false, or real.

In the face of these evolutions, how is our consciousness, cognition, and body affected?</p>

            <div class="width33 three-column-text">yet within this space in which our risk probabilities are calculated, our options tested and our outcomes pre-designed, there’s a space of real possibility and responsibility. If we no longer exist as mere “users” but as “constituents”, perhaps we can take our new role more actively 
            and creatively as part of a complex ecology of linkages between different actors. All these different actors (from interfaces to algorithms and from objects to media) have different dispositions – a tendency, activity, faculty or property – that have a specific relationship to one another other.

            <div class="width33 three-column-text"> By hacking or navigating these dispositions it is possible to shift or restructure our realm of possibility.
            In Extrastate Craft: The Power of Infrastructure Space, architect theorist Keller Easterling replaces Marshall McLuhan’s famous dictum “The Medium is the Message” by “The Action is the Form”. 
            For Easterling the organisational formats are not what surrounds the design; they are the design. Easterling employs the term “disposition” to
            refer to “active forms” which produce actions that lend an organisation some other undisclosed agency or capacity.

            <div class="width50 smalltext">Better than to hold on to design entangled in a modern, material culture (the pebble), let’s start to also imagine design as a practice that maps, intervenes and challenges existing processes and repurposes them towards other (more exciting) ends (the ripples). In an essay on speculative design, .<br><br>
                Bratton notes, perhaps “the job of Design in the 21st century is to undo (much of) the Design of the 20th”. Not only is it necessary to undo what exists, but also to design and reconfigure the normative relationships between things such as contracts, protocols, mediation, communication flows, and social or digital encounters. Design has the powerful faculty to create new meaning. Simulation, resistance, reappropriation and negotiation are only a few of the strategies designers with a critical attitude can apply to produce other narratives, what one might call a form of critical imagineering.</div>

              Guidelines for the Human Factor, Nascimento developed an algorithm-based workspace where
              the robot plays the role of a moderator, while humans discuss a relevant topic connected to a
              real world situation. According to a set of rules and based on voice recognition, the algorithms
              participate in the dialogue by offering references that influence the dialogue between the
              humans. In a way, the project comments on the role of bots and trolls that participate in online
